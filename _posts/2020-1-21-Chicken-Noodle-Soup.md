Delicious made from scratch Chicken Noodle Soup

- Rotisserie chicken
- 5 carrots
- 2 bunches of celery
- 3 yellow onions
- 2 heads of garlic 
- Egg noodles
- Dill
- Ginger
- (Optional) Lemongrass
- (Optional) 1 Tbsp peppercorns

## Instructions

To make stock:
1. Strip rotisserie of meat (set aside for later). Put bones and any remaining juices in instant pot.
2. Chop 2 carrots, 1 celery bunch, and 2 onions all in half. Add to instant pot. Leave all skins and stuff, it will be discarded in the end.
3. Chop 2 garlic heads in half horizontally to make sure every clove is cut. Again leave skin on. Put in instant pot.
4. Add peppercorns if including.
5. Fill instant pot up to max fill line with water. 
6. Close lid, set instant pot to high pressure for 45 min. When it is done, you can manually release the pressure.
7. Carefully strain stock into big container/pot. Discard all solids. They icky. 
8. Salt to taste. You want it slightly saltier than you'd think because it will mellow out when other things are added.

To make soup:
1. Cook noodles in very salty water. Strain. Add a little oil to prevent sticking. Season with pepper and set aside.
2. Dice 3 carrots, 1 onion, and about 5 stalks of celery (can add more or less depending on your preference). Keep all three ingredients separate after chopping. They cook at different rates.  Do not finely dice, more like a large chop, or else they will disintegrate in the soup.
3. Boil stock in a big pot (might not be able to fit all of pre-made stock in a pot, just freeze whatever is left over). After it comes to boiling, reduce to a simmer. 
4. Add celery and simmer until slightly transparent. 
5. Add carrots and simmer until just undercooked. You don't want them too soggy, and they will continue to cook after this step.
6. Add onion and simmer until transparent. Turn off heat.
7. Add chicken. Add salt if needed.
8. Finely chop dill and add to taste to soup. Keith likes a ton. Gabby likes a minimal amount. Your choice. 
9. KEEP NOODLES AND SOUP SEPARATE UNTIL YOU'RE READY TO EAT IT. Put some noodles in a bowl, ladle some soup on top, and BAM deliciousness.
