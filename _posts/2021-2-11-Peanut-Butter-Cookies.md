1. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Line two 18 by 13-inch baking sheets with silicone baking liners or parchment paper. 
2. In a medium mixing bowl whisk together flour, baking soda, baking powder, and salt. Set aside.
3. In the bowl of an electric stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment cream together butter, granulated sugar, and brown sugar until combined.
4. Mix in peanut butter then blend in egg and vanilla. With mixer set on low speed slowly add in flour mixture and mix just until combined. 
5. Scoop dough out and shape into balls (30 grams each or nearly 2 Tbsp) then place on baking sheets spacing them 2-inches apart.
6. Using a long pronged fork flatten cookies slightly then turn fork going opposite direction and flatten just slightly again (it should create that criss cross pattern).
7. Bake cookies in preheated oven, one sheet at a time, for about 9 minutes* (cookies will appear pale and slightly under-baked, they'll continue to cook slightly as they cool). 
8. Let cool on baking sheet 5 minutes then transfer to a wire rack to cool completely. Store cookies and an airtight container.

*Baking time ends up being more around 11-13 minutes
